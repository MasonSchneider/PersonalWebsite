# Creating My Personal Website

## My Personal Development Setup

* Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen5
* Debian 9
* Sublime Text 3

## Ruby Versions, Oh My!

## Finding a Jekyll Template

### I'm not a designer or a photographer

### Logo, Nogo

## Jekyll Template Copying?!

## Jekyll Versioning

## Github Deployment

Setup
Only had 2.3
Pains of upgrading to 2.6
Templates
Finding out that jekyll templates must be copied over instead of simply installed or swapped
Template on the right version of Jekyll
Template sites built on jekyll and not maintained - mostly a one time search
Images
Iâ€™m not a designer or a photographer
Many templates assume I have images to add in a size they want
