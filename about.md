I love how much is possible through code! Software engineers can go from building the next viral game to improving healthcare. I started learning programming in the seventh grade because I thought it would make me an "Elite Hacker" but I ended up making a text based adventure game in Basic and I've been hooked on software ever since. When I'm not programming I can be found hiking, scuba diving, and travelling.
